# Statistical DRP (Patterns, Predictions, and Actions) & Deep Learning Practice

This repository combines two components of my independent study and research during Autumn 2025:

1. **Statistics DRP: Patterns, Predictions, and Actions**  
   Mentor: **Ronan Perry**  
   Student: **Ariel Fu**  
   All DRP materials—including my final presentation and final write-up—are located in the `DRP/` folder.

2. **Deep Learning Tutorial Practice**  
   My practice code while self-learning the UW–Madison *Introduction to Deep Learning* course taught by **Sebastian Raschka** on YouTube.

## 1. Directed Reading Program: *Patterns, Predictions, and Actions*

**DRP Info Page:**  
https://spa-drp.github.io///past-projects/2025-autumn/

This DRP is a guided reading of *Patterns, Predictions, and Actions*, focusing on key ideas in statistical decision-making and machine learning.  
Topics studied include:

- Prediction and evaluation of predictive models  
- Optimization of actions using observed data  
- Generalization to unseen data  
- Foundations of statistical learning and decision theory  
- Implementation of numeric solutions to small applied problems

### DRP Folder Contents (`DRP/`)

- Final presentation slides  
- Final write-up  
- Additional notes, exercises, and implementation files

### Prerequisites (from official DRP description)

- At least one course in probability and statistics  
- Comfort with programming in R or Python  
- The level of the DRP is flexible and adjusted to the student

## 2. Deep Learning Tutorial Practice

This repository also includes my code practice following the UW–Madison *Introduction to Deep Learning* course by Sebastian Raschka.

**Course Playlist:**  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IHxe4-09e4&list=PLTKMiZHVd_2KJtIXOW0zFhFfBaJJilH51&index=106

Topics implemented in practice code include:

- Neural networks from scratch  
- Backpropagation  
- Activation functions  
- Optimization algorithms  
- Regularization methods  
- CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, self-attention and other core architectures (as learning progresses)
